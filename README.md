powershell gui that lets you join hidden roblox subplaces easily

***

## requirements

1. powershell
2. bloxstrap/fishstrap/any bootstrapper but the official one

## how to use it

after running the script, try to input any placeid into the textarea. right click on a subplace to join it. now we need to find the right delay.

if it closes roblox before even showing the loading screen or before showing the game's banner, and/or tells you that you do not have permission to enter the game without even throwing an http error, make the delay higher.
if it closes roblox after showing the game's icon, make the delay lower. only change the loop delay to something lower if it's too inconsistant. after that it will work almost everytime if you're doing everything correctly (and have a decent pc).
